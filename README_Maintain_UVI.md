(1) Sense keys and framenet mappings have been added to all the VerbNet classes. Make sure before you change anything in the svn to run 'svn up' and get the latest version. Whenever members are moved, make sure to keep their sense key and fn mapping the same. Whenever a member is added, find the highest sense key for that verb, and just add one to make a new sense key! Deleting members should be fine - we don't need the sense keys to be strictly ordered in any way.
