        NOTE: Nothing is necessarily getting removed from the container,

        example 2.

        NOTE: compare carefully to sense 6; in this sense, you must state the 
              substance being removed.  Ie, 'He dipped into the container' does not
              entail that water was removed. Also, the 'source' is a location, not 
              a resource.

        NOTE: compare carefully to sense 4; in this sense, the 'resource' cannot 
              be substituted with the thing  'taken out' 
              *(not good) 'We dipped money from our savings account.'
