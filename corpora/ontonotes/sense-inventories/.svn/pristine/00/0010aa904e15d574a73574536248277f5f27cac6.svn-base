	NP[+accuser] BLAME NP[+causer] (PP[+outcome])
	NP[+accuser] BLAME NP[+outcome] PP[+causer]

        NOTE: The cause/blamed is not necessarily responsible for the outcome. The accuser
        assigns this responsibilty (probably based on circumstance or evidence). Note that unlike
        in sense 2, negation will take away the cause:
        &quot;I didn't blame the mess in the kitchen on John.&quot;  = John did not make the mess.
      </commentary>
      <examples>
	They blamed the accident on the icy road.
	They blamed the icy road for the accident.
	Mary blamed John for the mess in the kitchen.
	Analysts are blaming the overheated economy for the current rise in inflation.

	NP[+agent] BLAME NP[+recipient] PP[+attribute/action]
        NOTE: unlike sense 1, a specific cause may not be given here
        NOTE: Although it is often used in the negative, it is clear that the recipient
        possesses or shows the attribute.  Unlike in sense 1, negating the sentence does
        not take away the attribute:
        &quot;I don't blame Sally for being mad,&quot; does not mean that she isn't mad.  She is. 
      </commentary>
      <examples>
	The critics blamed the film for being violent.
	I don't blame Sally for being mad about this.
	Can you blame them for being suspicious?
	Bob often gets blamed for speaking too loudly.
