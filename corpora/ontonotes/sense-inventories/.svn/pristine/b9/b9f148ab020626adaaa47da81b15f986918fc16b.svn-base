        Note: Although this sense may or may not involve something being dropped, 
              an essential part of its meaning is getting rid of something unwanted.
        Note: This sense also includes selling unwanted goods cheaply as a way of
              getting rid of them.

       Syntax Is:
        NP1[agent[human]] DUMP NP2[human[patient]]

        Note: the relationship could be romantic or otherwise. This sense also has
        the notion of 'getting rid of unwanted item', but it's more than that since
        it has to do with severing a human relationship.
