      <commentary>
        Syntax Includes:
        NP1[agent] PRESUME NP2[attribute]
        NP1[agent] PRESUME SCOMP
        NOTE: This sense can occur whether there is reasonable proof or not
        for something to be true. Usually this is based on a person's
        logic. See example 2 where the reason can be stated, but is not
        necessary. This sense occurs frequently in the passive as in the
        last example, where the active version of it is in parentheses.
