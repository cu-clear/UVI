	Note: compare to sense 1; in this sense, there is an implied time at which an event should
        occur.  (Negotiations are a scheduled event; in &quot;I was delayed&quot; there is an inferred expected
        time that &quot;I&quot; should have left the office)
        Note: There is a specific endpoint! May be obvious or implied.
