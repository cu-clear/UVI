      Syntax Includes:
      NP1[agent] VIBRATE NP2[patient[concrete]]
      NP1[theme[concrete]] VIBRATE PP[directional]
      Note: Thing vibrating must be concrete; even in the example of 'air',
      it is the molecules of air that vibrate and thus it is concrete; this
      does not mean that the stimulus/agent has to be concrete, however.
