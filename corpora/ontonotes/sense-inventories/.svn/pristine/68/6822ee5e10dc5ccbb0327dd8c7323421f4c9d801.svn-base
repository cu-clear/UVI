            FLIGHT[+form][+trajectory]
            Note: implies a single gravitationally-influenced arc, not a sustained process using wing lift.
            Note: focus is on the form of the traversed path, not the activity of being airborne
            Note: rockets may escape the gravitational field, but they are not airborne because of wing lift, but pure propulsion.

            The arrow's flight was a parabolic arc from the bow to the target.
            The white plume of exhaust defined the rocket's flight into the heavens.
