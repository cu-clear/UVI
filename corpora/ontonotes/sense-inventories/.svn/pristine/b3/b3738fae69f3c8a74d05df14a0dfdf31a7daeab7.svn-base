            John's father served as navigator on a B-24 during World War II.
            We got to meet the ship's navigator on a tour of the cruise ship.
            The navigators on ships during past centuries guarded their knowledge carefully.
            The pilot had to fly using dead reckoning after his navigator became incapacitated.

            Henry Hudson was an early English navigator of North America.
            The 15th and 16th century Portuguese navigators explored much of the world by sea.
            That boy is the youngest navigator to sail around the globe single-handedly.
