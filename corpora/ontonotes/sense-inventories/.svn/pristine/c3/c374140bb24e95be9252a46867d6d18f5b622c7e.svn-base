            Printing the flyers wasn't difficult, but their distribution across campus took all day!
            I supervise the distribution of Christmas bonuses among our employees.
            I was the supervisor of the Distribution department.
            The product had some interruptions in its distribution chain.
            Poorly-executed distribution can really kill a new product.

            The state of being spread out; the spatial property of being scattered over an area.
            Can also refer to the particular way that something is scattered (for example, the distribution of income).

            There's a wide distribution of singing talent in this chorus.
            I'd say that Starbucks coffee shops have achieved a pretty good distribution across the country.
            Our newspapers have a strong distribution on campus.
            I wrote a paper on the current distribution of income in Canada.

            The test scores for the midterm fall into a classic Gaussian distribution.
            I studied the types of statistical distributions that numbers can fall into.
