        Syntax is: NP1[agent] WEAVE NP2[+plural/first component] (IN/INTO/WITH NP3[second component])

        NOTE: Compare to sense 2. This sense involves two or more items
        being weaved together (and the method), the end product is not the
        focus nor does it need to be stated. As in the 2nd sentence, the 'ribbon' is the
        patient, the basket is the object.
