     These senses are left separate b/c in all three FN/VN/PB databases there
     are specific mappings for both senses.

   <sense group="1" n="1" name="create a new entity by putting components or members together" type="">
      <commentary>
      Syntax Is: NP1[animate] ASSEMBLE NP2[singular,object created] (FROM/WITH NP3[plural,individual
        members of collection])
        NOTE: The object created MUST BE specified while the components may or may
        not be specified. Also, compare carefully to sense 2, the object
        created must be a named entity and thus you could not break up the
        entity and call the individual components by the same name. For
        example, in the last sentence, the parts of a bicycle each have
        individual names.

   <sense group="1" n="2" name="collect similar or related items in one place" type="">
      <commentary>
      Syntax Is:  NP1[agent] ASSEMBLE (NP2[theme[plural]]) (PP)
        NOTE: If the sentence has no NP2, then NP1 will be the individual
        units as in example 2. Also, compare carefully to sense 1, none of
        the NP's purposes or qualities are altered as a result of the
        assembly process. 
        NOTE: The individual units assembled together do not get a
        different name because they are grouped together. Compare to Sense 1.
