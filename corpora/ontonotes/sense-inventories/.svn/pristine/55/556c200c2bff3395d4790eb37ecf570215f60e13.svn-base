        Syntax includes: NP1 STEAL NP2
                         NP1 STEAL AWAY/OUT PP
        Note: In this sense, STEAL usually is accompanied by a nominalized verb (verb-made-noun).
        Also note that the NP2 (what is stolen) cannot come into existence before the action of
        stealing (as opposed to things like wallets, hearts, or memories that exist even before
        the actual act of stealing).
        Note: The last two examples in this set specifically means &quot;to move or carry stealthily&quot;.
