       Syntax Is:
        NP1[agent] CONDEMN NP2[theme] to NP3[goal]
         NOTE: compare to sense 1; these senses are related, but
              the NP2 in this sense may not necessarily be guilty
              but may be a victim of circumstance. Also the state/punisment
              NP is required for a sentence to fit into this sense.
