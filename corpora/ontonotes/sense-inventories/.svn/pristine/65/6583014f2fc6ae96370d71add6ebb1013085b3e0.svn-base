	Syntax is: NP1 SUSTAIN NP2[benefactor] (PP[manner/durative])
                   NP1[agent] SUSTAIN NP2[event/state]
        NOTE: It may be difficult to distinguish between a sustained benefactor
              and sustained event or state (which may be metaphorically interpreted
              as a benefactor); thus, this sense includes both frames mentioned above.
