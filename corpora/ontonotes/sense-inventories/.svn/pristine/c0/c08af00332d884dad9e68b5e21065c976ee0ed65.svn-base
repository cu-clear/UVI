        NOTE: compare carefully to sense 2; in this sense, the dissolved entity
              is broken down, and often absorbed by a medium
        Note: Usually refers to a liquid medium, but not always
        Note: May be used metaphorically but the medium must be present in the sentence.

        NOTE: compare carefully to sense 1; in this sense, the entity dissolves becomes the 
              resulting entity (not merely a part of it, or merely absorbed
              into it); the resulting entity must be named in the sentence.
        Usually used abstractly or metaphorically

        NP1[agent] DISSOLVE NP2[patient[human[plural]]]
        NOTE: compare carefully to sense 1; in this sense, the resulting state is separate components,
              (ie, 'ethnic enclaves') not an encompassing situation (ie, 'apathy and drowsiness'.)
              Also, this sense refers specifically to the cessation of function or organization and the unit must be implied or named.
