        Includes: BET ON
        NOTE: this may be interpreted as a subset of sense 2; if money is involved
              this sense should be chosen (naturally, the better may often feel
              certain that what they are betting on is true or will occur)
        NOTE: this is only if money or valuable item is wagered or gambled

        No gambling is implied. No money or goods are wagered.
        The subject is usually (but not always) in 1st person.
