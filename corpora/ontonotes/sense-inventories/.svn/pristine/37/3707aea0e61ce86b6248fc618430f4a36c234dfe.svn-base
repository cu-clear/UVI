        B. Motion and/or location are often coded with a preposition.

        Syntax includes: NP1[agent] SNEAK (PP) NP2[object] (PP)
        Includes: SNEAK IN, SNEAK OFF WITH
        NOTE: Includes the subsense 'to steal'. The PP always occurs, but
        can occur before or after NP2 and usually doesn't encode motion in
        the way it does in sense 1. The emphasis is on NP2 not the
        motion of NP1 or 2.
