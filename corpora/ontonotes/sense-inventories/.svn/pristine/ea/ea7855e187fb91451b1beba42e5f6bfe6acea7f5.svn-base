        or supporting with no actual walking involved.

        (1) public act with the intent to publicize,
        (2) purpose that is to be made public 
        NOTE: just the simple act of marching in a large group does not
        qualify under this group.  Funeral, band, holiday or other similar 
        processions ONLY falls here if there is a reason/cause behind such 
        procession that needs to be brought to public awareness.
