        NOTE: Includes metaphorical uses. Compare carefully to sense 4. In
        the [concrete] examples, a concrete INSTRUMENT (a rubber stamper)
        is being used to 
        produce an image on another concrete item (a letter/wax for
        example), but the instrument is not permanently attached to the item. 
        NOTE: Compare to Sense 4; Sense 3 is NOT the affixation of a
        postage stamp.
        INCLUDES: STAMP OUT

        NOTE: In this sense a concrete item (a postage stamp) 
        is being permanently attached to another concrete item (a letter,
        for example). Use this sense ONLY if this specific condition is met.
