        NP1[+agent] STRAIN NP2[+object] (PP[direction,location])

        NOTE: Compare to sense 2, this sense refers to straining an object 
          where sense 2 refers to straining to do an action. eg. 'straining
          one's back' vs 'straining to lift something'. Thus if a PP is 
          used without NP2, NP2 is implied. Includes metaphorical uses.

        NP1[+animate] STRAIN VP[infinitve] (NP2[-concrete])
        
        NOTE: compare to sense 1. This focus of this sense is the exertion, 
              to perform an action, as opposed to the harm inflicted upon the 
              object of the action. eg. 'straining to see' vs 'straining your eyes'
