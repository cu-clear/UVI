        <commentary>
            A method of acknowledging somebody or saying hello.  An expression of good will on meeting.  
            The phrase &quot;greetings&quot; is itself a greeting.

            John gave me his usual chilly greeting.
            &quot;Greetings, earthling,&quot; said the little green man.
            My favorite greeting is &quot;G'day!&quot;
            That's not a proper greeting for such an old friend.
            He wrote a formal greeting at the top of the letter.
            A business greeting should be friendly, but not too friendly.

            Since we all took turns hugging each other, our greeting lasted a few minutes.
            In return, I sent John a greeting card on his birthday (a card that performs the act of greeting).
            The greeting of the guests will occur shortly after they arrive.
