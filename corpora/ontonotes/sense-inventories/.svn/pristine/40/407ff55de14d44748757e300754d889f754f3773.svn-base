        <examples>
            The campers pitched their tent in the lee of a boulder.
            We should anchor the boat on the lee of the island.
            (Note: the lee of the island is different from a 'leeward shore' which is -not- sheltered from the wind; it's a dangerous shore the boat can be blown against)
