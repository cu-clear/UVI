        Includes: GUARD AGAINST
        Syntax Is: NP1[agent] GUARD NP2[patient[concrete]] (PP{against NP})
        Note: NP2 can sometimes be a location, but it still needs to be
        [+concrete] and when you use GUARD AGAINST, the third NP must be a threat
        that is [+concrete]. When NP2 is a location, this sense applies to
        BOTH keeping things in and keeping them out.

        allowed release.
