        Includes: LINK UP
        Note: In this sense, the linking does not at all imply a relationship between/among the 
        entities linked. If there is a logical or causal relationship, then choose sense 1.
        Note: This sense usually refers to electronic, technical, or physical joining
        of two unrelated things by a third thing (a media; the link itself).
