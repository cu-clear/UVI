            John hated to be the conveyor of bad tidings to his staff.
            The lady down the street is the main conveyor of gossip in our neighborhood.
            The stewardesses had now become the conveyors of food carts down the aisle.

            One of the luggage conveyors at the baggage claim is not working.
            Each candy is formed by a machine and then passed along a conveyor belt for inspection.
            That firm manufactures several lines of conveyor platforms.
