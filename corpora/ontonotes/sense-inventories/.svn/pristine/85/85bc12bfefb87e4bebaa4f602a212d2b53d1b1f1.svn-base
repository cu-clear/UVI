        NOTE: compare carefully to sense 2.  This sense may include instances 
              of WHACK NP PP[+directional (off)]
              Remember that with these instances, you cannot move the NP after the PP:
              Ex: The taxi whacked him off his scooter.
              *The taxi whacked off him his scooter.
              Compare to Sense 2: Instances that do not originally contain [+directional (off)] will not be able to take the particle:
              The hitter whacked the ball.
              * The hitter whacked off the ball./The hitter whacked the
              ball off.

        Is: WHACK OFF (no sexual connotations)
        NOTE: compare carefully to sense 1; in the VPC use,
              the NP can split the verb and particle, or appear after the particle:
              Ex: The salesman whacked twenty percent off.
              The salesman whacked off twenty percent.
