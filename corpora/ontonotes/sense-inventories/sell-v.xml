       SELL SHORT:
       Method of profiting from a declining stock price by borrowing 
       shares of the stock, selling them at the market price, and then 
       repurchasing the same number of shares at a future date 
       (and at a lower price, if you're lucky) 
       to return them to the original lender.
      </commentary>
      <examples>
        Investors who sell short believe the price of the stock will fall.
