            ADVISOR[+academician][+professor]
            [+role][+mentor][+intellectual]
            Note: a narrow sense of Sense 1, related to just the academic world
            Note: also implies a different direction in the power relationship: the professor has more power than the student, this direction is different than for Sense 1
