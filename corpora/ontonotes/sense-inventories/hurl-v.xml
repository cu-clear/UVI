        At least 11 worshippers were killed and dozens wounded when
        suspected militants hurled grenades into a mosque in northwest
        Pakistan during Wednesday evening prayers, an official said.
        He hurled at Aias with his bright spear.
        He laughed, hurled insults and kicked me as I lay on the street sobbing.
