            I studied all night for my Linguistics final.
            It's almost finals time.
            The final begins at noon and ends at six-thirty.
            John failed his final because he'd been studying the wrong subject.

            Our team made it to the finals!
            The final is going to be played on Saturday at ten o'clock in the morning.
            We lost the final and went home.

            The actual exam, as a piece of paper, that students write on at the end of an academic term.
            Use this sense only when it is very clear that a physical object is being referred to.
