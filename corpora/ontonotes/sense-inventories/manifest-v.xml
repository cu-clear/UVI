      Syntax Includes:
      NP1 MANIFEST NP2[patient[concrete]]
      NP1[agent] MANIFEST
      Note: May be reflexive.   
      Note: See final example. Unlike in Sense 1, the NP2 in Sense 2
      becomes [concrete] by the action of the verb and thus may be
      considered concrete in the syntax.
