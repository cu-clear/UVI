        NOTE: This verb is prone to ambiguous sentences like 'I am going to
        go paint.' where no other information is given so it could be
        tagged at sense 1 or sense 2. If you come across an instance that
        is TRULY ambiguous, please tag it a both sense 1 and sense
        2. However, if you believe an instance fits better in one sense than
        another (as in examples 1 and 3 in this sense) please choose the
        most likely sense.

        NOTE: This sense also could have some ambiguity as in example 2.
        If there is no more context for example 2, it potentially could be ambiguous.

      that chair.' would be in sense 1.
