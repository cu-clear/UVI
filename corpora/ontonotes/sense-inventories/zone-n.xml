            Agreed upon zones.  Mainly geographical, clearly defined with discrete boundaries.  Something that could conceivably appear on a map.

            I changed my watch after switching time zones.
            The South Temperate Zone is the area between the Antarctic Circle and the Tropic of Capricorn.

            area - 
            Used more frequently.  Word indicating space - not previously
            established.  Not demarcated by clear boundaries.  Metaphoric or vaguely-defined zones.

            During this game of tag, the safe zone will be from those trees to the swing set.
            Parachuters try to land on the drop zone.
            This is a tidal action zone.
