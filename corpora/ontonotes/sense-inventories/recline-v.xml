      <examples>
      She reclined her head on the pillow.
      There were plenty of soft cushions and carved benches to recline upon.
      As I recline, my head stays more or less vertical.
      If only I could keep the person in front of me from reclining back into my spleen.
      The seat reclines to a full 160 degrees to provide the most comfortable sitting position possible.
