      Syntax Is:
        NP1[agent[human]] COMMAND NP2[patient[plural]
      
       NOTE: PATIENT may be animate or inanimate. [+human] can be an
       organization made of human entities (like sentence 3). NP2 CANNOT be a count noun like
       'dog' (cannot be split up into smaller components) but must be a
       mass noun like 'company' or 'budget' (can be split up into smaller
       components) or a plural noun like 'dogs'.

     Syntax Is:
      NP1[agent[human]] COMMAND NP2[patient[human]] 
       NOTE: may take passive voice. Agent might not be explicit (see
      example 3). In rare cases, the agent can be [-animate] as in example
      4, but in these cases the agent is seen to be personified (or rather
      'made animate').
