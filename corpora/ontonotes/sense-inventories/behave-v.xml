        NOTE: Compare carefully to sense 1; this sense is for 
              inanimate objects that cannot be agentive. In sense 1,
              it may be ambiguous as to whether or not the NP chooses
              to &quot;act or perform&quot; in a certain manner.  This sense is
              unambiguous.
