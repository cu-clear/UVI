      <commentary>
      Syntax Is: NP1[agent] INTERRUPT NP2[patient[animate]] (PP)
      NOTE: NP2 must be affected by the verb; the activity cannot be the
      core argument affected (the patient). Compare to Sense 2, where the
      opposite is true.
      NOTE: Use this sense for interrupted speech, as in conversation.

      <examples>
        Never interrupt me when I'm trying to interrupt you.
        When you're father is playing with his trucks, don't interrupt him.
        I promise never to interrupt you while you're on the phone.

        Syntax Is: NP1[agent] INTERRUPT NP2[patient]
        NOTE: The activity interrupted may or may not continue when the
        interruption is over.
        NOTE: Compare to Sense 1; in Sense 2, the activity, not the
        person/group, is directly affected by the verb.
