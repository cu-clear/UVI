            An aspirated 'p' in English is a phone that occurs in word initial position, e.g., 'pot' and 'pantry'
            Unaspirated 'p' in English occurs after another consonant, e.g, 'spot' and 'spout'.
            Speakers of a language are usually not aware of all the phones they use when speaking.
