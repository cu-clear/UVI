   Another possible sense: 'The herd watered.' This was suggested in tagger
   feedback but seems to be just a reflexive version of sense 1.

        Syntax includes: NP1[agent] WATER NP2[patient]
                         NP1[agent] WATER NP2[concrete]

        NOTE: Compare to sense 3. The NP being watered does NOT experience
        a change of state. Also the NP2 does not need to be explicitly
        stated as being living (as in example 2) but a living thing always
        occurs as a result (i.e. the field contains living plants).

        Syntax is: NP1[agent] WATER DOWN NP2[concrete]

        sense the NP being watered down experiences a change of state.
