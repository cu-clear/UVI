        Syntax Includes:
        NP1[theme[inanimate]] ROAR (ADVP[manner]) PP[directional]
        NP1[agent[animate]] ROAR (ADVP[manner]) PP[directional]

        Includes: ROAR OFF

        NOTE: in this sense 'roar' does not JUST refer to the sound an NP
        makes but also (in the case of an animate NP1) the manner in which
        NP1 moves.
