        Includes: FLIP OVER
        Note: This sense refers to an item that is independantly separated
        from all other items like a coin or a pork chop. Can include a path
        of motion where NP2 moves from one point to another.

      <commentary>
        NOTE: This sense refers to items that are attached to a larger mass
        like a light switch or a page in a book. Can include an implied
        path of motion (as in turning pages in a book) but the location of
        NP2 does not fundamentally change.

        Note: NP2 can be [+concrete] only if it's reversing direction not
        'turning over'. Also NOTE: FLIP-FLOP should be tagged as NOA
        because it is related to the verb 'flop' NOT 'flip.'
