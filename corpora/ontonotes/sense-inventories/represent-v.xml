        represented are separate 'entities'; in this sense, the representing item shows
        the represented item in particular form. (The &quot;young girl&quot; is actually the &quot;wife&quot;
        at an earlier time, the content of the &quot;report&quot; is the &quot;current situation&quot; (abstract)
        in a written (concrete) form.) 
        Includes acting on a stage or to behave as though one is acting on a stage.
