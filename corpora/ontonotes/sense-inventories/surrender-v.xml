        Syntax is: NP1[agent] SURRENDER
                   NP1[agent] SURRENDER (NP2) to NP3
        NOTE: compare carefully to sense 2; in this sense, there may actually be an 
              object (NP2) &quot;surrendered&quot; (oneself, one's life, one's soul)--in such
              cases, the surrendering of NP2 renders NP1 under the control of NP3

        Syntax is: NP1[agent] SURRENDER NP2[+possession] (to NP3)
        NOTE: compare carefully to sense 1; in this sense, the surrendering of NP2
              does not entail that NP3 has control over NP1
