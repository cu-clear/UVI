        Note: CAREFUL:
        The text must indicate in some way that writing is involved
        in order for you to select this sense! Ex: &quot;She noted everything he said,&quot; should 
        be tagged as sense 1; &quot;She noted everything he said *in her diary*&quot; would be 
        tagged as sense 2.
