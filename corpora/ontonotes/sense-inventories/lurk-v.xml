      Syntax Is: NP1[agent] LURK
      Note: NP1 does not have to be [animate] but must be construed as an
      agent or actor. See example 4.

      <examples>
      High school students like to lurk around in Central Square.
      Who is this man lurking around the department?

      Syntax Is: NP1[theme] LURK
      Note: NP1 is often abstract.
      Note: NP1 cannot be an agent; in example 2 below, for instance,
      stocks do not move of their own accord.
